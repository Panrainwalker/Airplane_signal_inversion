The project aims to simulate and invert airplane-generated seismic signals recorded by a dense geophone array using numerical modeling and robust parameter estimation techniques.

## Overview

This work reproduces airplane signal characteristics observed in dense seismic arrays through:

- **Numerical forward modeling** of acoustic waves from flying sources.
- **Time-frequency analysis** to extract Doppler features.
- **Robust inversion** using IRLS (Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares) to estimate aircraft trajectory and velocity.

The goal is to understand and replicate the main ideas from Meng & Ben-Zion (2018), focusing on the physical interpretation of observed airplane signals.
