# Decoding Complex Flight Kinematics 
## Overview

Airplanes create sound and ground vibrations that change in frequency as they move—much like the changing pitch of a passing siren.  By analyzing these Doppler patterns recorded by **microphones or seismometers**, or even extracted from **video data**, we can infer not only an aircraft’s **speed and direction**, but also its **acceleration** and **turning motion**.  


This work develops a comprehensive method to extract such detailed flight behavior and validates it using both **field data** and **historical footage**, including the **September 11, 2001 aircraft impact** on the World Trade Center.  
The results demonstrate how existing **seismic and acoustic data** can be leveraged to monitor and interpret aircraft activity.


## Complex Kinematic Modeling

We introduce **complex kinematic source modeling** to simulate realistic aircraft trajectories, including:

- Curved flight paths (e.g., turning maneuvers)
- Variable-speed motion with acceleration or deceleration

These kinematic models are implemented in MATLAB (`./modeling/complex_kinematic_modeling/doppler_fwd_chgdirection.m`, `./modeling/complex_kinematic_modeling/doppler_fwd_acc.m`).

## 9/11 Aircraft Inversion

As an advanced application, this work includes **Inversion of the 9/11 aircraft kinematic parameters**, using:

- **Observed frequency–time curves** extracted from the original footage of 9/11 event.
- **Forward simulation** based on `doppler_fwd_acc.m`.
- **MCMC inversion** to estimate the aircraft’s speed, distance, and acceleration parameters.

This inversion demonstrates how acoustic data can recover **flight kinematics** with high precision highlighting the potential of seismoacoustic monitoring for aviation safety, airspace management, and forensic event reconstruction.

**Example:**  
The 9/11 aircraft inversion can be reproduced by running the MATLAB script:

```bash
./inversion/complex_kinematic/MCMC_911_overtone.m
```
